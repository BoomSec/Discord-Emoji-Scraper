# Discord-Emoji-Scraper
This is a proof of concept scraper that runs through every possible combinations of numbers that go into a discord emoji ID. 
It will then check to see if an emoji is attached ot that link. If there is an emoji on that link, it will save that link to a text file named "EmojisPng.txt"

I put it here so if anyone wants to improve the code, maybe make it run faster because if this were to be run at a larger scale. It would likely be recognised as a DDOS attack.
Here is a link that may help us on our search;
